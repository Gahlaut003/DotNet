|    The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the             |
|    application lifecycle and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is       |
|    achieved by restricting the instantiation of the class to a single object. It is commonly   |
|    used to manage shared resources such as configuration settings, logging, or database        |
|    connections.                                                                                |

|    - Private static field to hold the single instance.                                         |
|    - Private constructor to prevent external instantiation.                                    |

|    The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows             |
|    subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Instead of instantiating      |
|    objects directly, the client relies on a factory method to create the object. This          |
|    promotes loose coupling between the client and the concrete classes it depends on.          |
| ‚úÖ Mechanism:                                                                                  |
|    - Abstract class or interface declares a factory method.                                    |
|    - Subclasses override the factory method to create specific objects.                       |
| üéØ Why Use:                                                                                    |

|    - Promotes loose coupling between client code and object creation.                         |
|    - Simplifies code maintenance and testing.                                                 |

|    The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or      |
|    dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is particularly useful      |
|    when the system needs to ensure that a group of objects are designed to work together.      |
|    This pattern encapsulates the creation logic for a family of objects into a single          |
|    factory interface, making it easier to switch between different implementations.            |
| ‚úÖ Mechanism:                                                                                  |
|    - Define an abstract factory interface with methods for creating each type of object.       |
|    - Implement concrete factories for specific families of objects.                           |
| üéØ Why Use:                                                                                    |

|    The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, |
|    allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful    |
|    when creating objects that require multiple steps or configurations. By using a builder,    |
|    the client can construct an object step-by-step and have greater control over the           |
|    construction process.                                                                       |

|    - Define a builder interface with methods for configuring parts of the object.             |
|    - Implement concrete builders for specific representations.                                |

|    The Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object,       |
|    known as the prototype. This is particularly useful when object creation is expensive       |
|    or complex. Instead of instantiating a new object from scratch, the prototype is cloned,    |
|    which can significantly improve performance and simplify object creation.                   |
| ‚úÖ Mechanism:                                                                                  |

|    - Improves performance by reusing existing objects.                                        |

|    A contract that defines a set of methods or properties that a class must implement.         |
|    Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and promote loose coupling.                     |
|                                                                                                |

|    The process of creating a copy of an object. In the Prototype pattern, cloning is           |
|    used to create new objects by copying an existing prototype object.                        |
|                                                                                                |

|    The process of setting up an object with specific properties or parameters. Builder         |
|    patterns are often used to handle complex configurations.                                  |
|                                                                                                |

|    A user interface that works consistently across different platforms (e.g., Windows,         |
|    macOS). Abstract Factory patterns are commonly used to create cross-platform UIs.          |
|                                                                                                |

|    A process where an object is built incrementally by configuring its parts one at a          |
|    time. This is a key feature of the Builder pattern.                                         |
