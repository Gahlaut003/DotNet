# 🔹 What is a Delegate?

---

## ✅ Definition

- A **delegate** is a type-safe object that holds a reference to a method.
- It acts like a **function pointer** in C#, allowing methods to be passed around as variables.
- Delegates can invoke one or more methods dynamically at **runtime**.

---

## 🎯 Why We Use Delegates

### 🔁 1. Decoupling Callers from Implementations
- The method caller doesn't need to know the method's logic.
- You can pass logic as a parameter, enabling dynamic behavior.

```csharp
void Execute(Action action) => action();
Execute(() => Console.WriteLine("I'm dynamic!"));
```

---

### 🧩 2. Events and Callbacks
- Delegates form the core of **event** mechanisms in C#.
- Useful for notifying other parts of a program when something happens.

```csharp
public delegate void Notify();
event Notify OnCompleted;
OnCompleted += () => Console.WriteLine("Finished!");
OnCompleted?.Invoke();
```

---

### ⏱️ 3. Asynchronous Programming
- Delegates support **BeginInvoke** and can be used with async/await patterns.
- Enables non-blocking execution in background threads.

```csharp
Action asyncWork = () => Console.WriteLine("Running in background");
asyncWork.BeginInvoke(null, null);
```

---

### 🧩 4. Extensibility & Flexibility (LINQ, UI, etc.)
- With `Func<>`, `Action<>`, you can dynamically inject logic.
- Delegates enable reusable, flexible pipelines.

```csharp
var evens = list.Where(x => x % 2 == 0).ToList();
```

---

### 🔁 5. Multicast Behaviors
- Delegates can point to **multiple methods** using `+=`.
- Great for broadcasting to subscribers.

```csharp
Action notify = () => Console.WriteLine("First");
notify += () => Console.WriteLine("Second");
notify();
```

---

## ❓ What Problem It Solves

### 🚫 1. Avoids Hardcoded Method Calls
- Instead of fixed logic, pass the behavior as a delegate.

```csharp
Filter(numbers, IsEven);
bool IsEven(int x) => x % 2 == 0;
```

---

### 🧩 2. Enables Plug-and-Play Behavior Injection
- You can change behavior at runtime without rewriting logic.

```csharp
var result = Filter(numbers, x => x > 5); // inject logic
```

---

### 🔁 3. Promotes Inversion of Control (IoC)
- The delegate lets the **callee** decide what logic to execute.

```csharp
RunWorkflow(OnStart);
void RunWorkflow(Action callback) => callback();
```

---

### 📦 4. Encapsulated, Reusable Invocation Logic
- Delegate logic is reusable and portable across modules.

```csharp
public delegate bool Validator(string input);
bool ValidateInput(string val, Validator rule) => rule(val);
ValidateInput("admin", s => s.Length > 3);
```

---

## 🔑 Additional Key Points

### 🔧 1. Generics with Delegates
- Delegates can be generic, allowing type-safe operations for various data types.
- Examples include `Func<T, TResult>` and `Action<T>`.

```csharp
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
Console.WriteLine(add(3, 5)); // Output: 8
```

#### 🔍 Why Use Generics with Delegates?
- **Type Safety**: Generics ensure that the parameters and return types are checked at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Reusability**: A single generic delegate can be used for multiple data types, avoiding the need to define separate delegate types for each scenario.
- **Simplified Syntax**: Built-in generic delegates like `Func<>` and `Action<>` simplify the process of defining and using delegates.

---

### 🌀 2. Functional Programming
- Delegates are foundational to functional programming in C#.
- Enable higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and LINQ.

```csharp
var squares = numbers.Select(x => x * x).ToList();
```

#### 🔍 Key Functional Programming Concepts
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return them as results. Delegates make this possible in C#.
- **Immutability**: Functional programming often emphasizes working with immutable data, and delegates align with this principle by enabling transformations without modifying the original data.
- **Declarative Style**: Delegates allow you to express "what to do" (e.g., filtering, mapping) rather than "how to do it" (e.g., loops).

---

### ⚖️ 3. Comparison with Interfaces
- Delegates are lightweight and focus on single-method invocation.
- Interfaces provide a broader contract with multiple methods.

```csharp
// Delegate
public delegate void Logger(string message);
Logger log = Console.WriteLine;

// Interface
public interface ILogger { void Log(string message); }
class ConsoleLogger : ILogger { public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message); }
```

#### 🔍 When to Use Delegates vs Interfaces
- **Delegates**:
  - Best suited for scenarios where you need to pass a single method as a parameter (e.g., callbacks, event handling).
  - Lightweight and concise, with no need to define a full interface.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Ideal for defining a contract with multiple methods or properties.
  - Useful when you need to implement a broader set of behaviors in a class.

---

### 🔗 4. Chaining and Invocation List
- Delegates maintain an invocation list for multicast behavior.

```csharp
Action notify = () => Console.WriteLine("First");
notify += () => Console.WriteLine("Second");
foreach (var method in notify.GetInvocationList())
    method.DynamicInvoke();
```

#### 🔍 Key Points About Invocation Lists
- **Order of Execution**: Methods in the invocation list are executed in the order they were added.
- **Dynamic Inspection**: The `GetInvocationList()` method allows you to inspect the methods in the delegate's invocation list, enabling dynamic manipulation or debugging.
- **Error Handling**: If one method in the invocation list throws an exception, the remaining methods are still executed. You can handle exceptions individually to ensure robustness.

### 🛠️ 5. Delegate vs Lambda Expressions
- Delegates are the underlying mechanism for lambda expressions.
- Lambdas provide a concise syntax for defining delegate instances.

```csharp
Action greet = () => Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
greet();
```

#### 🔍 Key Differences Between Delegates and Lambdas
- **Delegates**:
  - Explicitly defined types that represent method references.
  - Require more boilerplate code to define and use.
- **Lambda Expressions**:
  - Provide a shorthand syntax for creating delegate instances.
  - Often used inline, making the code more concise and readable.
  - Can capture variables from the surrounding scope (closures).

## 🔍 Types of Delegates in C#

According to the official documentation, delegates in C# can be categorized as follows:

### 1️⃣ **Single-Cast Delegate**
- A delegate that references a single method.
- Commonly used for scenarios where only one method needs to be invoked.

```csharp
public delegate void PrintMessage(string message);
PrintMessage print = Console.WriteLine;
print("Hello, Single-Cast Delegate!");
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Multi-Cast Delegate**
- A delegate that references multiple methods.
- Methods are invoked in the order they were added to the delegate.

```csharp
Action notify = () => Console.WriteLine("First");
notify += () => Console.WriteLine("Second");
notify(); // Output: First, Second
```

#### 🔍 Key Points:
- Use the `+=` operator to add methods and `-=` to remove them.
- Exceptions in one method do not stop the execution of others.

---

### 3️⃣ **Generic Delegates**
- Built-in delegates like `Func<>`, `Action<>`, and `Predicate<>` provide generic support.
- Simplify delegate usage without explicitly defining custom delegate types.

```csharp
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
Console.WriteLine(add(3, 5)); // Output: 8
```

#### 🔍 Built-in Generic Delegates:
- **`Action<T>`**: Represents a method that takes parameters but does not return a value.
- **`Func<T, TResult>`**: Represents a method that takes parameters and returns a value.
- **`Predicate<T>`**: Represents a method that defines a set of criteria and returns `true` or `false`.

---

### 4️⃣ **Anonymous Delegates**
- Declared inline without explicitly defining a method.
- Useful for short, one-time-use logic.

```csharp
Action greet = delegate { Console.WriteLine("Hello, Anonymous Delegate!"); };
greet();
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Lambda Expressions**
- A concise way to define delegates using the `=>` syntax.
- Often used with LINQ and functional programming.

```csharp
Action greet = () => Console.WriteLine("Hello, Lambda!");
greet();
```

---

### 6️⃣ **Custom Delegates**
- User-defined delegates for specific use cases.
- Provide flexibility for custom method signatures.

```csharp
public delegate int Operation(int x, int y);
Operation multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
Console.WriteLine(multiply(3, 4)); // Output: 12
```

#### 🔍 Key Points:
- Custom delegates allow you to define specific method signatures.
- Useful when built-in generic delegates do not meet your requirements.
